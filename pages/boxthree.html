            <p>Here I am using a test API. This API has the data about theaters around Denver,CO. I print the theaters' name, movies' name, show time and IMDb address from the test API. I used ng-repeat to build the table. And actually the table was built in a directive and I used isolated scope in this directive.</p>
            <p>I also used promises to make sure that while JS is doing the AJAX call, JS also can do other staff.</p>
            <p>Please do not hesitate to click the button below to see more about theaters around Denver,CO.</p>
